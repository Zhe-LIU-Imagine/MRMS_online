///////////// Description
/// For each octave:
///    	- Divide in par.Scales scales
/// 	- Convolve and compute differences of convolved scales
///	- Look for a 3x3 multiscale extrema and contraste enough and with no predominant direction (no 1d edge)

/// For each extrema
///	- Compute orientation histogram in neighborhood.
///	- Generate a keypoint for each mode with this orientation

/// For each keypoint
///	 - Create vector
